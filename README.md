[Ashen](https://codeberg.org/ficd/ashen) is a warm, muted theme born from the
glow of dying embers — rich in reds, orange highlights, and layers of gray.
Inspired by _Dark Souls III_, it's crafted to be gentle on the eyes and steady
on the mind. Whether you're deep in the terminal or writing code by candlelight
— Ashen offers a calm, focused atmosphere for development after dark.

This monorepository contains official implementations of Ashen across a range of
editors, terminals, tools, and more — each carefully tuned to carry the same
muted warmth. The project is developed on
[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/ficd/ashen) and provides a read-only mirror on
[GitHub](https://github.com/ficcdaf/ashen). Please see

If you're porting Ashen, use the existing ports as a reference for the palette
and overall feel. Treat [Helix](./helix/README.md) as the "ultimate" guide on
the colors to be assigned to syntax elements.

As a rule of thumb: numbers and builtin literal types should be `blue`, strings
`red_glowing`, keywords `red_ashen`, operators `orange_blaze`, delimiters
`orange_smolder`, brackets `g_6`, and special punctuation `orange_golden`.
`red_flame` should _only_ be used for errors, and `orange_golden` is the
preferred color for warnings. Ashen doesn't use green, so you can pick an
appropriate substitute from the palette. For example, the terminal themes use
`orange_blaze` for green, which looks good in most applications.
